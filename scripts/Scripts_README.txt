 
All the python scripts can be called from the commandline. Use the "--help" flag to get a quick overview of available options.

The workspace has to be sourced (see ROS tutorial), to locate "rospkg".

.pyc files are compiled scripts and can be ignored or deleted.

You can call the scripts from anywhere with rosrun. Example command:
$ rosrun rover_sim world_build.py --help
