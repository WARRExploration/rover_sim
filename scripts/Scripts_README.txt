 
All the python scripts can be called from the commandline. Use the "--help" flag to get a quick overview of available options.

The workspace has to be sourced (see ROS tutorial), to locate "rospkg".

You can call the scripts from anywhere with rosrun. Example command:
$ rosrun rover_sim world_build.py --help
